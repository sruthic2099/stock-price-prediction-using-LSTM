Predicting stock market is one of the most difficult tasks in the field of computation.
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have proved one of the most powerful models for processing sequential data. 
Long Short-Term memory is one of the most successful RNNs architectures. LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation.
This method is well suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data.
The main purpose of the prediction is to reduce uncertainty associated to investment decision making.
